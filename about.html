  <h1>About Us </h1>
  <p>my company is called housing for homeless and what we do id that we provide houses for the people who are not as fourtunate as thoes who have houses. I belive that this company can make a very big impact in the impoverished communities and hopefully give unhoused people and families another chance at what they couldve had before their life went bad </p>
